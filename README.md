# Terraform Configuration Documentation

# Purpose

The Terraform configuration automates the deployment and management of infrastructure resources on a cloud provider AWS.

### Steps

1. **Download AWS CLI**: Download AWS CLI and Install it.
2. **Create AWS Access and Secret Key**: Create AWS credentials Access and Secret Key.
3. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Terraform configuration files.
4. **Configuration Customization**: Modify the variables.tf file to customize configuration parameters such as instance type, region, and other resource settings.
5. **Terraform Initialization**: Run **terraform init** to initialize the Terraform working directory.
6. **Plan**: Run **terraform plan** to preview the changes Terraform will make to the infrastructure.
7. **Validate**: Run **terraform validate** to preview infrastructre working fine.
5. **Apply**: Run **terraform apply** to apply the Terraform configuration and provision the infrastructure.
6. **Verification**: Verify that the resources have been provisioned successfully by checking the cloud provider's console or using Terraform outputs.
7. **Management**: Use Terraform commands (e.g., `terraform destroy`, `terraform refresh`) to manage the infrastructure lifecycle as needed.

## Directory Structure

```
terraform/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── scripts/
│   └── setup.sh
└── README.md
```

- **main.tf**: Contains the main Terraform configuration defining resources.
- **variables.tf**: Defines input variables used in the configuration.
- **outputs.tf**: Defines output values to be displayed after resource provisioning.
- **scripts/**: Directory containing scripts used for resource setup or configuration.
- **README.md**: Documentation providing an overview of the Terraform configuration and usage instructions.

## Additional Notes

- **Security**: Ensure that sensitive information such as access keys, passwords, and private keys are managed securely.
- **Version Control**: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes to the Terraform configuration files.
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation to facilitate collaboration and troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

The Terraform configuration simplifies infrastructure management by automating the provisioning and deployment of resources. By following the provided guidelines and documentation, users can efficiently deploy and maintain infrastructure in a consistent and reproducible manner.
